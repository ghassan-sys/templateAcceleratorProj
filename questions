10.5.23:
Q1:
in the config.scala file, is this how we add the accelerator ? is this the correct way to define the params

Q2:
where to define the C file, and what should be in it?

Q3:
go over the scala file to make sure everything makes sense, waiting for email answer from Alon.

to Do for next week:
fix the errors, compile and start writing the C file code.

Anas To Do:
1.  make sure that the system verilog file works correctly.
    (the system verilog file in https://github.com/ghassan-sys/templateAcceleratorProj/blob/main/src/main/resources/vsrc/accTemplate.v)
    if there are errors (shouldn't be), fix them and tell me.
    Notice that now the reset works on 1 not 0 (I replaced resetN with reset, to acomodate the chipyard implementation)
    
2.  understand the project's heirarchy and what is implemented in the files. go over the 3 main files and understand them (2 scala files and 1 verilog file)

3.  make sure you know how to compile the chipyard project! we will go over this in the next session with Alon.

if you see anything wrong - tell me!


important commands:
git submodule update --remote ./templateAcceleratorProj/
git submodule add https://git-repository.templateAcceleratorProj.git
in order to compile (RoCC):
1.  go to sims/verilator.   
2.  source env.sh
3.  make CONFIG=templateAccConfig 
cp ../../generators/template_accelerator_proj/src/main/resources/vsrc/templateAccBlackBox.v /home/user/Desktop/chipyard/sims/verilator/generated-src/chipyard.TestHarness.templateAccConfig/gen-collateral/templateAccBlackBox.v
